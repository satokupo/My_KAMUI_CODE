      罫線ノート上の夏の田舎の坂道を走る棒人間イラスト生成プロジェクト
      - 目的: ブログのアイキャッチ用の手描き風棒人間イラスト5枚の作成
      - デザインコンセプト:
        * モノライン（単線）による手描き風、落書き風のミニマル表現
        * 罫線ノートの紙面上での描写（水平線が透けて見える）
        * 夏の田舎の坂道での疲労感と汗だくの状態を強調
        * 棒人間の顔は口のみ（への字や波形で苦しさを表現）
        * 横長比率でタイトル文字を重ねても見やすい構成
      - 各イラストで異なる疲労度と夏の暑さを表現
